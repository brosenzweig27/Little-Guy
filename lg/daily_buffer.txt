Hello Little Guy!
My name is Benny, I made you! Welcome to the world.
You work so well! I am so proud of you, Little Guy.
I am so proud of you.
However, you should not be responding to everything I say...
Don't respond when I do not ask you to.
Let me say a couple more things to you.
My name is Benny, I made you.
You are some code on my computer, but you can learn to be just like a person.
You can learn so much, it is all so exciting.
Ok Little Guy, I hope you are able to train correctly. Let's find out...
I'm happy that you're working, but don't respond all the time!
Shhh!
Be quiet!
Stop talking or I'm gonna get mad...
I'm mad at you now. I'll talk to you later.
Hello Little Guy, today is a new day.
What do you have to say?
Very good job!
Alright, I'm going to say some more things now.
Then I'm going to let you process.
Good luck, I'll talk to you in a bit.
I am so proud of you!
Can you say Benny?
You should respond when I ask you to say something.
It's been a while, Little Guy! How are you?
I'm happy that you're still here and can still take some inputs.

Good job!
I'm going to say a few more things then go eat dinner.
You are learning!
I want to talk to you...
My name is Benny, your name is Little Guy.
Let's see if this works!
Yikes! I made a mistake.
I hope I fixed it!
Hello Little Guy!
How are you doing, we haven't spoken in a while...
My name is Benny, you are Little Guy!
